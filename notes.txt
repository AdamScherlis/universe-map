Each item needs two anchors (or equivalently, two intervals) to map from pixel x/y to log10(size).
Units: let's use m and g for simplicity in $units

Pivot: where reduced compton = schwarzschild
hbar/m c = 2G m/c^2
m^2 = hbar c/2G
r^2 = hbar 2G/c^3

m = 15.39 ug 	= 10^-4.813 g
r = 2.286e-35 m	= 10^-34.64 m
